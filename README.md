# Building a Scanning Framework in Python for an ASV Scanner

Developing a scanning framework in Python is an excellent foundation for creating an ASV (Approved Scanning Vendor) scanner. 

We shall outline the key components and steps involved in building a robust framework.

---

## 1. Understand the Requirements
Before building your scanner, identify the requirements:
- **Purpose**: Detect vulnerabilities, compliance issues, or both?
- **Scope**: Target network ranges, protocols, and services.
- **Compliance Standards**: Ensure adherence to PCI DSS or other relevant standards.

---

## 2. Tools and Libraries to Use
### Python Libraries
- **Nmap**: Use `python-nmap` or `libnmap` for network scanning.
- **Scapy**: For low-level packet manipulation and custom scanning.
- **Requests/HTTP Libraries**: For web vulnerability scanning.
- **Asyncio**: For concurrent tasks like scanning multiple targets.

---

## 3. Architecture of the Scanner
### Key Components
1. **Scanning Module**:
   - Use tools like Nmap to detect open ports, services, and versions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import nmap

     def scan_target(ip, ports):
         nm = nmap.PortScanner()
         nm.scan(ip, ports)
         return nm[ip]
     ```

2. **Vulnerability Database Integration**:
   - Incorporate CVE data from sources like NVD.
   - Query by detected services or CPE strings.

3. **Reporting Module**:
   - Generate detailed reports in formats like JSON, HTML, or PDF.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Support for custom scanning profiles (e.g., full scan, specific ports).

---

## 4. Implementing Core Functionality

### A. Service Detection
Use Nmap or Scapy to enumerate open ports and identify running services.
```python
def detect_services(target_ip):
    # Example using Nmap
    nm = nmap.PortScanner()
    nm.scan(hosts=target_ip, arguments='-sV')
    for host in nm.all_hosts():
        print(f"Host: {host}")
        for proto in nm[host].all_protocols():
            ports = nm[host][proto].keys()
            for port in ports:
                print(f"Port: {port}, Service: {nm[host][proto][port]['name']}")
```

### B. CVE Matching
Retrieve and match vulnerabilities from public databases.
```python
import requests

def fetch_cve(service_name, version):
    query = f"{service_name} {version}"
    url = f"https://cve.circl.lu/api/search/{query}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    return []
```

---

## 5. Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Scanning**: Use `asyncio` or `multiprocessing` to scan multiple targets simultaneously.
- **Caching**: Cache scan results to avoid redundant operations.
- **Resource Management**: Implement timeouts and retries to handle unreachable targets.

---

## 6. Reporting and Output
Generate clear and concise reports for end-users.
### Example Report Format
```plaintext
Target: 192.168.1.1
----------------------------------------
Port: 80
Service: HTTP
Vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-12345, CVE-2023-67890
----------------------------------------
```
### Code to Generate JSON Report
```python
import json

def generate_report(data, output_file):
    with open(output_file, "w") as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
    print(f"Report saved to {output_file}")
```

---

## 7. Testing and Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Validate each module independently.
- **Real-world Testing**: Test against a controlled environment or a public vulnerability testbed.

---

## 8. Extending the Framework
- **Add Plugins**: Support third-party plugins for additional checks.
- **Enhance UI**: Build a web-based dashboard for easier management.
- **Integrate AI**: Use machine learning models for smarter vulnerability detection.

Barebones for now.
We shall improvise as we proceed.
